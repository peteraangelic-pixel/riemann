    Used by interpreters whose initial state depends on a seed that agents

    weather rolls). The seed is taken from the first available source:
    ``env.info["seed"]`` (preserved across re-initialization), then
    ``configuration[config_key]``, then ``fallback()`` (defaulting to a random
    31-bit int). The value is then cleared from ``configuration`` so agents
    can't read it via the observation, and stored on ``env.info["seed"]`` so
    it persists into the replay.
