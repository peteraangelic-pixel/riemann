"""ARC-AGI-3 SDK adapter for the deterministic novelty-explorer baseline.

The policy itself lives in :mod:`policy` and has no third-party dependencies.
This adapter is intentionally thin: it converts ``FrameData`` to a Snapshot,
asks the policy for one legal proposal, and converts that proposal back to a
``GameAction`` expected by ARC's reference agent framework.
